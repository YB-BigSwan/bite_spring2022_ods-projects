				<h1>About Us</h1>

				<p>
					Born in El Paso, Texas and raised in Chihuahua, Mexico, Cecilia
					Cortazar Peterson’s passion for food started early and spanned two
					cultures.
				</p>
				<p>
					Her mother being a wonderful cook awakened Cecilia’s interest in food
					since she was 7 years old, also learning and helping her family’s
					cook, by roasting chiles, making corn tortillas from fresh masa and
					preparing traditional Mexican dishes like enchiladas, chile rellenos,
					rajas and of course TACOS.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cecilia eventually settled in America and continued her childhood
					traditions by cooking authentic Mexican cuisine for friends and family
					by hosting “taquizas” (taco parties) which were enlivened by her warm
					and friendly spirit. The popularity of her delicious food and
					personality eventually led to her catering events for friends and
					neighbors.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Sometimes its hard to find authentic Mexican food”: explains Cecilia
					“so that was my goal, to have a taqueria that represents my Mexican
					roots and traditions”.
