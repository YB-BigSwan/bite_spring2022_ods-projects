			<h1 class="title">Why we love tacos</h1>

			<p class="start">
				The taco is a staple of Mexican cuisine, so it might be surprising to
				learn that tacos don’t have a very long history. There is no exact
				history of where and when they came about. However, historian, Jeffrey
				M. Pilcher, professor of history at the University of Minnesota, has
				traveled around the world researching Mexican food. He has a few ideas
				about the history of tacos, and you may be surprised to read his
				conclusions.
			</p>

			<aside>
				<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
				While the hard taco is not a traditional Mexican staple. There is
				evidence that the hard taco shell existed in U.S. Mexican restaurants
				nearly a decade before they were used in Taco Bell. In fact, it is
				rumored that hard tacos are so popular because they stay fresh for much
				longer when compared to soft tortillas.
			</aside>

			<p>
				It is believed that the origin of the taco started in Mexican silver
				mines. Mr. Pilcher believes that they came about some time in the 19th
				century. This hypothesis about the taco comes from the fact that the
				first type of taco was “taco de minero,” which translates to mean
				miner’s tacos. Also, have you ever realized that taquitos look similar
				to a stick of dynamite? Taquito is a Spanish word that translates to
				small taco. It is believed that the word taco originally referred to
				pieces of paper that miners would wrap around gunpowder and use in holes
				that were carved into the face of the rock.
			</p>

			<p>
				So as you can see, the taco isn’t an age-old cultural food, it is fairly
				new, compared to some of the other Mexican foods dating back to Aztec
				times. The role of the “taquería” (taco shop) is also an important
				element in the history of the taco. For many years, taquerías were
				mostly for working class Mexicans. Many women migrants brought tacos to
				Mexico City to sell for income. These women eventually made Mexico City
				into a taco hub, with many different styles and kinds of tacos that
				people could sample.
			</p>

			<p>
				Even though you may be surprised that tacos did not exist in the Aztec
				days, we can agree that tacos are now a Mexican staple that is easily
				one of the most popular and delicious Mexican foods out there. If you
				like soft or hard tacos, you can experience a delicious meal at Todos
				Buenos Tequieria in our many locations across Finland.
