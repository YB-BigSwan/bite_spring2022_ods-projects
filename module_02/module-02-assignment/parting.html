			<!-- Poem -->
			<p>
				My life closed twice before its close;<br />
				It yet remains to see <br />
				If Immortality unveil <br />
				A third event to me, <br />
				So huge, so hopeless to conceive, <br />
				As these that twice befell. <br />
				Parting is all we know of heaven, <br />
				And all we need of hell.
