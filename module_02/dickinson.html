			I heard a fly buzz when I died;<br />
			The stillness round my form<br />
			Was like the stillness in the air<br />
			Between the heaves of storm.
		</p>
		<p>
			The eyes beside had wrung them dry,<br />
			And breaths were gathering sure<br />
			For that last onset, when the King<br />
			Be witnessed in his power.
		</p>
		<p>
			I willed my keepsakes, signed away<br />
			What portion of me I<br />
			Could make assignable &#8212; and then<br />
			There interposed a fly,
		</p>
		<p>
			With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz<br />
			Between the light and me;<br />
			And then the windows failed &#8212; and then<br />
			I could not see to see.
