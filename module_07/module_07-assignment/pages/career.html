					<h2 class="divTitle">Future Career Plans</h2>
					<p>
						Previously, I had planned to continue studying to get my Master's in
						psychology, in hopes of one day opening my own practice. However,
						after a 2 year internship at a residential treatment center, I
						discovered that it wasn't the right career for me. As much as I love
						helping others, the job was too emotionally draining for me and by
						the end of those two years, I dreaded going into the office. So I
						knew I had to find a new path.
					</p>

					<p>
						After the internship was over I took a year off to figure myself
						out. After asking myself what I wanted from my career, I decided
						that I wanted to find a career where I could solve problems, be
						creative, and have a secure job. A few weeks later, I was talking to
						a friend about this. He is a web developer, and he thought that I
						might enjoy the same sort of work. So, he pointed me towards a few
						online classes to try things out before fully committing and after
						the first few lessons I was hooked.
					</p>

					<p>
						That brings us to now. I'm currently studying IT(CS) at Haaga-Helia
						University of Applied Sciences in order to gain the skills necessary
						to start my career as a web or mobile developer.
